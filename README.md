# PassChecker
Using the https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords API, I created a more secure way to check if your password has been compromised.
It is a simple CLI tool. In order to run it:
1. Download the single file
2. open CLI of your choice and navigate to the file. Type "python 3 passcheck.py YOUR PASSWORD HERE"
3. it will then check the database that Have I Been Pwned uses to check how many times the password has been compromised.
4. using this program instead of the website skips the middle man and you don't have to send your password through the websites search.
